# NewtonMethod
Program which imitates Newton's Method (Idea from Calculus 1)

Features:
    -Uses form x_(i + 1) = x(i) - f(x(i)) / fprime(x(i)) 
    -Can take any polynomial and evaluate its closest x-intercept near the user's guess
    -Usually guesses until about 3rd repitition of value, then exits program

Current Limitations:
    -Currently cannot evaluate any trignometric functions
    -Cannot accept any input with parentheses
    -Only uses power rule to find derivative of f
